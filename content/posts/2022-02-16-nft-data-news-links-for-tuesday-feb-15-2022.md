via Decrypt | *2022 02 14* <br/><br/>
Aoki spoke at event for the recently launched Gala Music, an offshot of Gala Games and cited the potential for artists to earn far more via NFTs than streaming platforms

> “But if I was to really break down, OK, in the 10 years I’ve been making music… six albums, and you \[combine] all those advances, what I did in one drop last year in NFTs, I made more money. And also, I was way more unhinged with music,” Aoki said.

This  article outlines the potential benefits to marketing using NFTs, in an effort to dissuade FUD

> Few new technologies have generated as much buzz in recent years as nonfungible tokens, or NFTs. As with social networks, virtual reality and cryptocurrency when they first hit the scene, the excitement surrounding these unique digital assets has led many to question whether they will live up to the hype.

via Fortune | *2022 02 14* <br/><br/>
Making the case for how YouTube could take over the video NFT marketplace with a lack of a dominant video NFT marketplace in the current landscape

> The potential for a YouTube NFT marketplace is massive, based on the scale of the platform, and a lack of competition in video-specific marketplaces. OpenSea has captured 97% of all NFT sales and has proven to be the dominant platform at the moment. However, pictures and GIFs are the vast majority of content being sold on OpenSea and similar platforms.

via NFT Culture | *2022 02 15* <br/><br/>
Looks like CerealClub may be another rug. Always be weary of new projects with big, unverifiable claims.

> As with everything in NFT space please do your own research. Not all projects are required to have amazing roadmaps / utility to be successful. In that case community is everything. With the discord being closed off, it’s hard to know what is really going on. We have contacted the team for comments.

via Play to Earn | *2022 02 15* <br/><br/>
Single sided staking now available for $SAND tokens

> In December, $SAND token holders were able to provide liquidity pairs (ETH/SAND and MATIC/SAND) to earn rewards in $SAND. With this new update, holders can now single-stake their SAND tokens to receive rewards. This removes the risk or impermanent loss that can happen if the prices of the tokens provided fluctuate a lot.

Particle sells NFTs of a Banksy while continuing to display the physical - and without any authorization from the artist

> Particle Foundation will display the physical piece in museums worldwide and maintain ownership in perpetuity. Meanwhile, the fractionalized NFTs will give the new owners a chance to own a portion of the Foundation, and in turn, a portion of Banksy’s piece.

JPMorgan is the latest corporation to metaverse land, and this looks like marketing for a bigger push into metaverse investments

> JPMorgan unveiled the lounge as part of a broader research report covering the metaverse. In addition to noting the surge in the market capitalization of metaverse tokens since Facebook announced its pivot to Meta at the end of last year, the bank outlined some of the opportunities the metaverse presents for brands and consumers.
