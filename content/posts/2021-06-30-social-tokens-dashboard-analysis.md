Social tokens, such as those used by communities such as [Whale](https://whale.me/), [Bankless](https://www.bankless.community/), and dozens of others, have risen dramatically in popularity over the past year. In just the last 6 months, wallets holding tokens tracked by [Forefront.news](https://forefront.news/) have grown over 400% and it's unlikely to slow down. 

I recently developed a [Social Tokens Analytics Dashboard](https://duneanalytics.com/rantum/Social-Tokens), using Dune Analytics, for the tokens tracked by Forefront. The dashboard displays the number of wallets holding each token, as well as trades on decentralized exchanges (DEXes), and a cumulative look at the total number of wallets holding social tokens. 

With the help of Forefront contributor [Jihad](https://twitter.com/jaesmail), we co-authored an accompanying article, which has been published on mirror. Here's an excerpt from the article, [Social Tokens have grown over 400% in 2021](https://ff.mirror.xyz/XFuXL8vVZtk3kTldgS6VlDc5Y6uKpfxGJsQ5MECa1Rc): 

> Over 16,000 wallets now hold social tokens, with over 10,000 new wallets introducing social tokens since the beginning of this year. Since August 2020, the number of wallets holding $FF tracked tokens has grown over 1400%, while the number of tokens tracked increased from 9 to 25. While Forefront doesnâ€™t track every token in the space, the growth here is indicative of much larger trends across the ecosystem.
